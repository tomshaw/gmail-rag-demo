   python app.py

   # Specify a different label
   python app.py --label="SENT"

   # Specify number of emails to fetch
   python app.py --limit=25

   # Specify both label and limit

   python app.py --label="Parent\\Subfolder"

   # Examples:
   python app.py --label="Work/Projects"
   python app.py --label="Personal/Receipts"
   ```
